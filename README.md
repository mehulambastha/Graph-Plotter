# Graph Plotter

This is a light-weight web application written in vanilla javascript which plots line charts.

## How it works

It accepts input data in JSON format with x and y coordinates.<br>
Then it scales the coordinates to a suitable scale-factor and draws the chart with co-ordinates of each point displayed above the respective point.
